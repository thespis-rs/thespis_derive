> Derive macros for thespis traits

This crate provides a few convenience macros for the _thespis_ library. They are all re-exported from [_thespis_](https://docs.rs/thespis),
so you shouldn't need to use this directly.

Please check out the [guide level documentation](https://thespis-rs.github.io/thespis_guide/).
